    "\n",
    "You have seven days to complete the assignment. We estimate that the work required should take only a few hours at most. A jupyter notebook is provided as a starting point, but you are free to use any other format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please pay attention to the code and the description of your approach and results. The code should be well-documented and easy to understand. Additionally, we expect that you will provide a clear description of your approach to the problem and the rationale behind your methodology. In case of doubt, you can take any assumption you think is reasonable but make sure you explain it well. Lastly, we encourage you to present your results in an easy-to-understand manner, including visualizations and other appropriate metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "We wish you the best of luck in completing the exercises, and we look forward to reviewing your submission. "
